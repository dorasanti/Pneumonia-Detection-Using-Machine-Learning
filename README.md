# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the "Pneumonia Detection" project which was created in July of 2022. 
This machine learning program uses a kaggle dataset of 2,000 images in order to create a binary classification model 
which can detect if a patient has pneumonia/covid by analyzing the x-ray image of the patient's lungs.
